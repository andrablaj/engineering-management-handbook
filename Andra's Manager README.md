# Hi, I'm Andra, Engineering Manager. 👋
This document is a short introduction to me and my working style. I'm going to change, you're going to change, and this is a living document that will change as I learn more about myself and how we can best support each other. Nevertheless, I truly believe that “the most efficient & effective method of conveying information… is face-to-face communication”.

## My Job 💻 
The focus of my job is the who and the how, but I truly care about the why, and I will do everything to ensure this is clear to you too.
My primary responsibility is to support and grow engineers to build relevant and accessible tools.

## Values ✨
- **People First**, as happy, informed, and productive people build awesome things. 
- When in doubt, **over-communicate**.
- **Commitment**. We are present when we come to work. We give it our best. We choose to be here. 
- **Integrity**. “Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.” (C. S. Lewis). We tell the truth to each other and ourselves. We see things as they are, not as we want them to be.

I am rated as a [Protagonist in 16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality).

## Quirks 😬
- I am over-organized. I like templates, checklists, bullet points, and plans and tend to put an order in documents, processes, and agendas, …. It seems like a weird thing for me to be writing here, but I do think that we CAN get too organized. Often this puts a lot of pressure on myself and the people I work with as I am trying to get better at figuring out the areas that need “organizing” attention vs. areas that don’t.
- My close friends often tell me that “I go faster than the music” (French: Je vais plus vite que la musique). I have tons of enthusiasm and desire to get things done, and I sometimes miss the big picture or the consequences of some actions. Please stop and question me if that's the case. I try to assess better my decisions' long-term and big-picture impact.
- I love emojis. 🫶  

## Admin Stuff 💼
- I plan on having a conversation with you at least weekly, but please feel free to reach out with any questions in between those conversations. 
- I am diligent about keeping my Google calendar up-to-date, and I leave 5-10 minutes of space between calls for note cleanup & quick breaks.
- (Bi-)yearly reviews are not the only time we will share feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I will ask you for feedback regularly, and no matter how often you say you have no feedback for me, I will never stop asking.
- My working hours are captured in Google Calendar. I will try not to ping you after hours (I use Slack’s scheduled send a lot). If I do ping or tag you outside your working hours, do not feel pressured to reply to me right away. If you need to discuss anything with me and cannot wait until the next working day, you can find my phone number in my Slack profile.

I wrote a lot here about myself, but an important part of my job is adapting to YOUR needs and values, and I look forward to talking to YOU about them!
