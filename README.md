# Engineering Management Handbook

💻 Resources for leading great teams of software engineers.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a tech professional & international development enthusiast with more than 10-year experience in software engineering and leadership roles.

I started as an Engineering Manager in May 2021, and learnt a lot through great resources I found all over the Internet. My life would have been a lot tougher without these amazing authors who shared their experiences and advice, and I am extremely grateful for that. This handbook is a compilation of links and templates that supported me in my Engineering Management journey.

## ⚙️ Engineering Management - All The Things

### Managers READMEs
I have a love-hate relation with Manager READMEs, as I am never confident that I am 100% self-aware (I am working hard to get better at that). While I do believe READMEs can be a great tool for getting to know our colleagues and their working preferences, I also believe that one needs a high level of self awareness and humility to get it right.

### Culture
- [Driving Cultural Change Through Software Choices](https://skamille.medium.com/driving-cultural-change-through-software-choices-bf69d2db6539).
  - _Developers have more power than they imagine to change the engineering culture around them. As you build software that others will use or that your peers will work on, are you making it easy for them to do the right thing? If you build platforms, bake in easy integrations for the software values you want to see. If you’re in the position to choose new tools, pick ones that support the standards you want taken seriously. And as you write code, make it easy for others who will copy-paste what you’ve done to then do the right thing._
  - _I’ve never met an engineer who didn’t occasionally copy-paste-modify some code. One of my earliest professional software lessons was that when you set up a codebase full of tests, other engineers are likely to write tests for their code because there will be lots of examples for how to test. This generalizes to the observation that people are most likely to take an existing thing and tweak it into a new thing that does what they need, and in the process they will take the good and bad from that existing thing. So if you want them to follow a best practice, put it in their starting templates._
  - _We can go further than observability. Security can be a process, or a cultural value, but you can also go quite far by providing tools and platforms that have good security practices baked in to them, so that you’re not relying on the good citizenship of your development team. Testing is often hampered by the overhead of running tests, and investment into infrastructure that makes tests easy and fast to run is important to supporting a culture of software quality validation._
