# WIP Engineering Management Handbook

💻 Resources for leading great teams of software engineers.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a tech professional & international development enthusiast with more than 10-year experience in software engineering and leadership roles. I am intentional in using my engineering passion to build (or lead teams that build) accessible and relevant digital tools that serve the underserved. 

I started as an Engineering Manager in May 2021, and learnt a lot through great resources I found all over the Internet. This handbook is a compilation of links and templates that supported me in my Engineering Management journey.  

Favorite quote by [Dr. Rumman Chowdhury](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rumman/), Slush 2017, Helsinki, Finland: 
> If what you build is not accessible to all, is neither radical nor revolutionary.
